## How to play the game on my computer?
As I said before, this game is made using Python and the Pygame module, so make sure you have these two installed on your local machine or else it will not work. And if you don't have Pygame installed on your machine just run the command:
> pip3 install pygame
OR
> pip install pygame
One of these commands will make the job done. And now to the most amazing part, running the code on your computer, so once you're in the "car-racing-game" directory run the command:
> python3 game.py
OR
> python game.py
And Enjoy the game.

## How the game is played?
The game is pretty simple and straight-forward: you're playing with a red car and you should overtake all the cars without hitting them, you can do so by using the left and right arrow keys. But be very aware because fir every 8 cars overtaken, the game speeds up.
